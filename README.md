# Chicken Siege

Chicken Siege is a top down tower defense game made in unity, scripted with C#. The goal is to stop the chickens along the path to the castle using towers. If too many chickens reach the castle, you lose. If you clear all of the waves of chickens, you win! Manage your money wisely and place towers strategically to beat all six levels.
